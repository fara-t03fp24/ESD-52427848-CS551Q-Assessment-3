# PrintCraft: Enterprise Software Development Report
University of Aberdeen

## Project Context
PrintCraft was developed as a solo assignment for the Enterprise Software Development module at the University of Aberdeen. The project implements a 3D model marketplace using Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, demonstrating enterprise-level software development without relying on external APIs.

## Architectural Design

### MVT Architecture Implementation
1. **Models (Data Layer)**
   - Custom User model with email authentication
   - Shop model for creator portfolios
   - Product model for 3D designs
   - Order model for transactions

2. **Views (Business Logic)**
   - Class-based views for CRUD operations
   - Function-based views for specific actions
   - Form processing views
   - Permission-based access control

3. **Templates (Presentation)**
   - Hierarchical template structure
   - Template inheritance
   - Custom template tags
   - Bootstrap integration

## Development Methodology

### Server-Side Approach
- Pure Django implementation
- No external API dependencies
- Server-side rendering
- Session-based state management

### Implementation Phases
1. **Foundation (Week 1)**
   - MVT architecture setup
   - Database design
   - Authentication system

2. **Core Features (Week 2)**
   - Template hierarchy
   - Form processing
   - File handling

3. **Business Logic (Week 3)**
   - Shop management
   - Product catalog
   - Order processing

4. **Refinement (Week 4)**
   - Template optimization
   - Security implementation
   - Testing coverage

## Technical Implementation

### Model Layer
- Custom model managers
- Model inheritance
- Database relationships
- Field validations

### View Layer
- Class-based views
- Mixins for reusability
- Context processors
- Form handling

### Template Layer
- Base templates
- Include patterns
- Custom filters
- Form rendering

## Testing Strategy
- Django TestCase implementation
- Model testing
- Form validation testing
- View testing
- Template tag testing

## Enterprise Considerations

### Scalability
- Template caching
- Database optimization
- Efficient queries
- Modular design

### Maintainability
- Clear MVT separation
- Documentation
- Code organization
- Testing coverage

### Security
- Django security features
- Form validation
- CSRF protection
- Session security

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Template Organization**
   - Challenge: Complex template hierarchy
   - Solution: Implemented systematic template inheritance

2. **Form Processing**
   - Challenge: Complex form validations
   - Solution: Custom form classes with validation logic

3. **File Management**
   - Challenge: Secure file handling
   - Solution: Django's built-in file handling with validation

## Technical Analysis

### Model Design Benefits
- Clear data relationships
- Built-in validation
- Query optimization
- Transaction support

### View Implementation
- Clean separation of logic
- Reusable components
- Permission handling
- Form processing

### Template Structure
- Consistent layout
- Code reusability
- Maintainable structure
- Efficient rendering

## Future Enhancements

### Technical Improvements
- Custom template tags
- Advanced caching
- Query optimization
- Batch processing

### Feature Additions
- Enhanced search
- Advanced filtering
- Batch operations
- Report generation

## Conclusion
PrintCraft demonstrates the power of Django's MVT architecture in building enterprise-level applications. The implementation showcases how complex business requirements can be met using Django's built-in features without external API dependencies.
